	<p>Throughout two weeks of waste tracking assignment, I realized most of my waste comes from plastic containers. For example, plastic cups, bowls, water bottles, spoons, forks, bags, and wrappers. I believe the situation is ironic because in short-run, these -including other wastes- are convenient for us but in long-run it will affect us in a bad way because it damages out Earth which will affect us back in a way. It was hard to pick the items for the ‚ÄòWaste Tracking Assignment‚Äô since they all have flaws and being able to redesign them is also a difficult task. üêª
