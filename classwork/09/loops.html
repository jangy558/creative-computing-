// the loop repeats these two steps:
// 1. check the boolean expression
// 2. if it's true, run what's inside. (repeat)

// Big idea of loop is that inside the ( ), it's true for some of the time and eventually becomes false. 

//if it's always ture, then you made an infinite loop and only way to get out of it is to close the tab.
